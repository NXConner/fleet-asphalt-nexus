# Lovable.dev Removal Plan

This document outlines the plan and recommendations for removing all references to Lovable.dev and 'lovable' tags from the codebase. Use this as a checklist and reference at the end of development.

## Files/Code to Edit or Remove

### 1. Vite Config
- `vite.config.ts`: Remove `lovable-tagger` import and any usage.

### 2. README
- `README.md`: Remove all Lovable.dev instructions, URLs, and branding. Replace with your own project description and setup.

### 3. Package Files
- `package.json`: Remove `lovable-tagger` from dependencies/devDependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Remove all `lovable-tagger` blocks. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` after editing.

### 4. HTML Metadata
- `index.html`: Replace all Lovable branding, images, and descriptions with your own project's branding and meta tags.

### 5. Deleted Files
- `deleted files/capacitor.config.ts`: If restoring, replace Lovable URLs and IDs.

## If Removal Requires a Service
- If any Lovable functionality is required (e.g., component tagging, analytics), replace with open-source alternatives or your own implementation.

## Steps to Complete
1. Edit and clean all files above to remove/replace Lovable references.
2. Remove the dependency and clean up the lockfile.
3. Replace any required functionality with a suitable alternative.
4. Update documentation and metadata for your own branding.
5. Reinstall dependencies to clean up.
