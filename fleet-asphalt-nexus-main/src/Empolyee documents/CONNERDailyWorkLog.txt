### **13. Administration Use Only**

*(To be filled out by Administration)*

#### **A. Total Expenses Calculation**

**Instructions and Formulas**:

*Use the data provided by the employee to calculate total expenses. Formulas and references to the employee sections are provided below.*

1. **Fuel Expenses (Vehicles)**:

   - **Formula**: `Total Fuel Used (vehicles) = Sum of "Fuel/Propane Used" for vehicles from Section 9`
   - **Calculation**: Multiply total gallons used by the current fuel price per gallon.

2. **Fuel Expenses (Equipment)**:

   - **Formula**: `Total Fuel Used (equipment) = Sum of "Fuel/Propane Used" for equipment from Section 9`
   - **Calculation**: Multiply total gallons used by the fuel price per gallon.

3. **Materials Purchased**:

   - **Formula**: `Materials Cost = Sum of (Quantity Used * Unit Cost) for all materials from Section 8-B`
   - **Reference**: Use quantities from Materials and Supplies Used and unit costs from inventory records.

4. **Equipment Maintenance**:

   - **Data Source**: Any maintenance needs noted in Section 8-C or Section 11.

5. **Tolls/Parking Fees**:

   - **Formula**: `Total Tolls/Parking Fees = Sum of any expenses reported in Notes or Expenses`

#### **B. Time and Payroll**

**Instructions and Formulas**:

1. **Total Hours Worked**:

   - **Formula**: `Total Hours Worked = Clock Out Time - Clock In Time`
   - **Data Source**: Times from Section 4 (Time Tracking)

2. **Total Time on Job Site**:

   - **Formula**: `Total Time on Job Site = Departure from Job Site - Arrival at Job Site`
   - **Data Source**: Times from Section 4

3. **Total Time Before/After Job Site**:

   - **Formula**: `Total Time Before/After Job Site = Total Hours Worked - Total Time on Job Site`

   - **Company Policy**: Regular hours up to 8 hours per day; hours beyond are overtime.
   - **Calculations**:
     - **Regular Hours**: Up to 8 hours
     - **Overtime Hours**: Total Hours Worked - Regular Hours (if Total Hours Worked > 8)

5. **Payroll Calculation**:

   - **Regular Pay**: `Regular Hours * Hourly Rate`
   - **Overtime Pay**: `Overtime Hours * Overtime Rate (1.5 * Hourly Rate)`
   - **Total Pay**: `Regular Pay + Overtime Pay`
